            Nice to meet you, I’m Kelly. I’m a UI/UX designer based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I’m highly invested in solving problems that arise within digital interactive systems. Whether it’s an app, a website, the user interface in your car, or the cockpit of an airliner I’m the person who wants to sink his teeth into the why and how that system can be more usable to the people intended to use it. I’ve worked for non-profits, startups, websites, and higher education organizations. The one constant is that I’m always looking for a new problem to solve, get in touch today to talk about how we can start cracking away at yours!
